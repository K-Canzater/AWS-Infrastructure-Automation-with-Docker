# 🐳 Docker Practice Lab

Welcome to my Docker lab focused on AWS infrastructure automation. This project showcases my ability to containerize Python scripts using Docker and interact with AWS services securely and repeatably — a foundational skill for real-world DevOps workflows.🚀

## 💡 Why I Built This

I created this lab to deepen my hands-on experience with:


- Containerizing infrastructure tools using Docker
- Automating EC2 instance operations with Python (Boto3)
- Managing environment variables and credentials securely
- Preparing for CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins jobs, and Kubernetes workloads
  

My goal is to simulate real-world DevOps tasks and demonstrate the ability to build reliable, portable automation tools.


## 🧠 What I'm Practicing

- Writing clean, efficient Dockerfiles for AWS infrastructure automation
- Containerizing Python scripts that use Boto3 and the AWS CLI
- Using `.dockerignore` to reduce image size and improve build performance
- Reproducing real-world DevOps workflows with Docker (credentials, environment vars, etc.)
- Building a foundation for Docker use in CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins jobs, and Kubernetes clusters

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-** Docker CLI – Containerizing infrastructure scripts**
- Python + Boto3 – Automating AWS actions (e.g., stopping EC2 instances)
- AWS CLI & IAM credentials – Secure access via mounted config
- Bash scripting – Automating deployments and AWS interactions
- VS Code & GitHub – Local development + version control


## 🔭 Future Enhancements

- Add Docker Compose for multi-container setups
- Introduce .env support for cleaner variable management
- Push images to Docker Hub for reuse
- Expand to ECS/EKS deployment testing
- Integrate into a full CI/CD workflow
