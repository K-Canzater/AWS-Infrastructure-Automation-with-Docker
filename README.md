🐳 Docker Practice Lab
The Vibe
Hey there! Welcome to my Docker practice laboratory where I'm leveling up my container game! This repo is basically my playground for mastering Docker fundamentals, containerizing applications, and experimenting with real-world container workflows. It's all part of my journey into cloud infrastructure and DevOps 🚀
📂 Project Structure

💭 What I'm Learning

Creating clean, efficient Dockerfiles that actually work
Building and running containers locally without drama
Using .dockerignore to optimize image builds and keep them lightweight
Running containerized apps with docker run like a pro
Setting up multi-container environments with docker-compose (coming soon!)
Implementing best practices for container workflows in real projects

🛠️ Tech Stack

Docker CLI
Python (Flask for now, might expand to other frameworks)
VS Code for development
Git & GitHub for version control

🚀 How to Run It
Build the Docker image
bashdocker build -t docker-practice-app .
Run the container
bashdocker run -p 8080:8080 docker-practice-app
🔮 Future Experiments

Docker Compose (multi-container setup)
Volumes and persistent data management
Networking between containers
Custom base images
Environment variables & .env files
Pushing images to Docker Hub
Deploying containers to AWS (ECS or EC2)

📝 Notes

Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine
All commands should be run from the root directory
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080 when running
