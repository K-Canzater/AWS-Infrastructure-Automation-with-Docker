# 🐳 AWS Infrastructure Automation with Docker

This project demonstrates automated validation and environment management of AWS infrastructure using Docker and Python. The containerized toolkit ensures configurations are consistent, repeatable, and compliant—mirroring QA principles of verification, error prevention, and process reliability. 🚀


## 💡 Why I Built This

I developed this project to deepen hands-on experience with:

- Automating AWS operations and verifying environment integrity
- Ensuring consistent deployment configurations and reducing manual errors
- Managing credentials securely to prevent misconfigurations
- Emulating real-world workflows to practice process validation and auditing


## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Automated verification of AWS EC2 instance lifecycle and configurations with Python (Boto3)
- Designed repeatable, testable workflows via Docker containers
- Implemented secure handling of credentials to ensure compliance and minimize human error
- Applied process validation techniques mirroring QA test execution and defect prevention
- Prepared scripts and workflows for future CI/CD integration, reinforcing automated testing principles


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Docker CLI | Python + Boto3 | AWS CLI & IAM | Bash | Git/GitHub
  
## ⚙️ Impact / QA Takeaway:

This project emphasizes accuracy, repeatability, and error detection, showing transferable QA skills in testing infrastructure, validating configurations, and building automated verification workflows.
