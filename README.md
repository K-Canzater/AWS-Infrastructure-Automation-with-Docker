# 🐳 AWS Infrastructure Automation with Docker

Welcome to my AWS Infrastructure Automation project using Docker. This repository showcases a containerized Python toolkit designed to automate AWS operations reliably and securely — a key capability for modern DevOps workflows. 🚀


## 💡 Why I Built This

I created this lab to deepen my hands-on experience with:


- Containerizing infrastructure tools using Docker
- Automating EC2 instance operations with Python (Boto3)
- Managing environment variables and credentials securely
- Preparing for CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins jobs, and Kubernetes workloads
  

Designed to replicate production-level DevOps workflows, this project highlights my ability to build portable, repeatable automation tools that streamline cloud operations.


## 🧠 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Developed optimized Dockerfiles to containerize Python automation scripts
- Automated AWS EC2 instance lifecycle management using Boto3
- Applied secure handling of AWS credentials and environment variables inside containers
- Emulated real-world DevOps scenarios including Docker image optimization with .dockerignore
- Laid the groundwork for future CI/CD and Kubernetes integration


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Docker CLI** – Containerizing infrastructure scripts  
- **Python + Boto3** – Automating AWS actions (e.g., stopping EC2 instances)  
- **AWS CLI & IAM credentials** – Secure access via mounted config  
- **Bash scripting** – Automating deployments and AWS interactions  
- **VS Code & GitHub** – Local development + version control

## ⚙️ What This Enables
This containerized automation toolkit ensures consistent, repeatable AWS environment management, reducing manual effort and minimizing configuration errors — essential for scalable, maintainable cloud infrastructure.




## 🔭 Future Enhancements

- Add Docker Compose for multi-container setups
- Introduce .env support for cleaner variable management
- Push images to Docker Hub for reuse
- Expand to ECS/EKS deployment testing
- Integrate into a full CI/CD workflow
